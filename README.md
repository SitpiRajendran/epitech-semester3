make                #  Compile
make clean          #  Remove *.o
make fclean         #  Remove binary and 'make clean'

### [CNA -  COMPUTER NUMERICAL ANALYSIS](https://github.com/SitpiRajendran/epitech-semester3/tree/master/CNA/CNA_groundhog_2019)
In order to support you in achieving your own algorithm, this unit is made up of the following elements:
 - a first project to introduce THE most used tools in the stock market field for decision taking (sell/buy/wait).
 - a second project "Trade", that takes you to the elaboration of your own algorithm.

-----
### [CPP POOL](https://github.com/SitpiRajendran/epitech-semester3/tree/master/CppPool)
The C++ Seminar (or Pool) is a key moment in Epitech training. 
Like the C-Seminar unit, it is intensive and highly instructive.

### [FUN - HASKELL](https://github.com/SitpiRajendran/epitech-semester3/tree/master/Haskell)
Functional programming and imperative programming are complementary. This is why properly mastering both paradigms will make you a better developer, one who is able to adapt to virtually any programming language. Furthermore, functional programming is a fundamental component of numerous other paradigms, like reactive programming.

-----
### [NWP - NETWORK PROGRAMMING](https://github.com/SitpiRajendran/epitech-semester3/tree/master/NWP)
All projects are to exclusively be done in C/UNIX, unless it is explicitly written otherwise in the subject.

This unit is specifically designed to introduce you to the following concepts: Network communication and Data packets

-----
### [OOP - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING](https://github.com/SitpiRajendran/epitech-semester3/tree/master/OOP)
The second year C++ course will introduce you to the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. 
We will discuss modularization and problematic' abstraction by using practical examples such as dynamic libraries.

-----
### [PSU - UNIX PROGRAMMING . MEMORY](https://github.com/SitpiRajendran/epitech-semester3/tree/master/PSU)
Next installment of the first year's UNIX system programming unit. All projects are to be exclusively done in C/UNIXX (given that it's the next installment of the 1st year's PSU)

-----
### [SEC - WEB SECURITY](https://github.com/SitpiRajendran/epitech-semester3/tree/master/SEC_CFP_2019)
Study of vulnerabilities linked to the development of Web applications. 
Non-exhaustive list of domains we will cover: Authentification, ACL, configuration, cryptography, encoding, error management, protocols, synchronization, language traps, Web Services, injections.
